build a scelton infurstructure of a web app that does the following: for now don't focus on the UI, just a simple UI to test the   functionalities, i will be using advanced UI library later, the web app is simple, just a way for the user to speak and have the audio   recorded (this will be done by the help of the library which a documentation guide is avilable in @docs/ricky0123-vad-web.txt with the help of    @docs/nativ-mediarecorder.txt to help with the actual recording on the browser for the web app), so the plan is to have the user launch a   "live" session, where after it starts the app listens to the user and when he stops talking, using langchain (which relevent docs in   @docs/langchain.txt ), will use the api from groq (which relevent docs are @docs/groq-typescript.txt ), to transcribe the audio just recorded   and then after transcribing step done, it calls the same api again to give the transcription to a llm model with a personilzed prompt (whcih   you tell me where the prompt variable is in the code so i can edit it if i want, right now the prompt is just asking the model to translate   the trenscriptin into spanish), once the response is gotten from the model, then the next step is to call the api again, this time to have the    response gotten in the second step to be an audio using a groq tts model, then after getting the audio, play it back to the user, and make   sure after each process with those 3 steps (considered one process for those 3 steps), if the user says anything else, the process starts from    the begingin, so meaning there is no saving of chat history or something like that, always as if new conversation in the point of view of the    llm, and make sure to use zustand for the state managment (which relevent docs will be found in @docs/Zustand.txt ), and for state managment   on server side use @docs/TanStack-query.txt (which is the docs for it also.
